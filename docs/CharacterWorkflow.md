# Character Workflow

How to build a character with [Daz3D](https://www.daz3d.com/), export it to [MotionBuilder](http://www.autodesk.com/products/motionbuilder/overview), bake [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) animations to the skeleton, take it over to [Maya](http://www.autodesk.de/products/maya/overview) for manual optimization and finally - export to [UnrealEngine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/) where we can use the model together with the animations with a full game character "blueprint"
