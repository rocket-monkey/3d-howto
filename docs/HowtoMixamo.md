_For e.g. a running animation, keep in mind we're going to build a game - meaning a running animation should not go from a to b, it should run "in place" -> the movement will be given trough the user input in the end, processed and set by the game-engine. So we're going to check "In Place" for such animations we select._

3. Now press "Add to Pack" on the bottom of the option pane

</p>
_By adding a first animation to a pack, we will create a collection of animations and giving them a name -> this is the name of the "locomotion". The locomotion is the "topic" which is be delivered by this animations in the final game -> the initial movement, walking into all directions, running, crouching and jumping could be just the "FemaleLocomotion", where the fighting stuff could be "FemalePunchLocomotion" etc._

4. Select more animations, choose options and finally "Add to Pack" them
